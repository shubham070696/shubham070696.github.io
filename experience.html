												My excellent performance during the internship won me a full time position at Philips. I was recruited as a Software Developer in Philips Healthcare, 
												a software company that focuses on improving the lives of its clientele by providing innovative healthcare solutions.
												Over the past two years, I have had the opportunity to render my services as a part of the CoreServices team and developed 
												applications such as providing software installation framework for different hardware platforms, OS automation suite engine, developed a new System Backup Restore tool in WPF .net framework with the 
												integration of Wbadmin of Microsoft to support the windows based volume level backup and restore for windows based workstation, to name a few. 
												Working with Philips was an eye opener in helping me understand how software development plays an important role in the healthcare domain to which I was able to relate and apply my knowledge to real world client projects.

											<p><B>
												
												My penchant to gain hands-on exposure to concepts of skills acquired during my undergraduation helped me land an internship offer with Philips Health Systems (Bengaluru, India). My role as an intern was to 
												develop an automation suite that could completely deploy the customized operating systems and configure the MRI health systems with required application software. It was a huge cost saver to Philips as it brought down the time of deployment of 14 hours to 4 hours.

												For the stint of 6 months at Philips, I was also repsonsible to imporve the code quality of MR codebase without hampering the actual code flow that required extensive code analysis and rigorous testing to attain the best performance and efficiency.

												The cumulative experiences of my education, work experience, and my interest towards data science domain had instilled a deep passion in me to pursue master's to scale up my knowledge.
